# A browser for your PDFs documents using bibtex

Tired of chosing the right filenames for your PDF documents? Or do they get too
long because they have to contain the title and the full author list?
`rofi-bibbrowser` solves all those problems!

## Configuration file
The configuration file is just a python script and located at
`~/.config/rofi-bibbrowserrc`. You can overwrite any function that has been
defined before and adjust it to your needs.
